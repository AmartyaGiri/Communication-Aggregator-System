Backend Engineer Assignment
Problem Statement
We want to design a simplified version of a Communication Aggregator System — a backend
that receives messages from multiple sources and routes them intelligently to the right
communication channel (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.).
You’ll design and implement a 3-microservice system that performs this routing flow
end-to-end.

PS - You may choose any tech stack – NodeJS GraphQL with async microservices
communication (RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, Kafka) would be plus.

System Overview
You will build multiple independent microservices that communicate with each other:

1

1. Task Router Service
● Accepts incoming message requests via REST /GraphQL API.
● Validates the payload.
● Applies routing logic based on the channel field.
● Logging
● Decides which delivery service to forward the message to.
● Example logic:
○ "email" → Email Service
○ "sms" → SMS Service
○ "whatsapp" → WhatsApp Service
● Should handle retry if delivery fails (simulate retry logic).
● Duplicate body handling/ should not send duplicate message

2. Delivery Service
● Simulates sending messages for Email, SMS, and WhatsApp.
● You don’t need to integrate real APIs — just log or store the message in a local DB

3. Logging service
● Produce logs for observability POV from service1 and service2 with complete journey of
API with trace and subtraces.
● Save these logs in Elasticsearch, such that it can easily use it as on Kibana for
troubleshooting.

Requirements 2

● Each service should run independently (separate ports or containers).
● Include a README explaining:
○ Architecture overview
○ Communication method and reasoning
○ How to start each service
○ Postman Collection.

Deliverables
1. High-Level Design (HLD)
○ Architectural Diagram
○ Show data flow between all 3 services
○ Mention chosen communication pattern and justification
2. Working Prototype
○ Source code of all 3 services
○ Basic setup/run instructions
○ Functional flow visible in logs and simple DB table
3. Short README
○ Overview of services and their purpose
○ Setup + run steps
○ Example payloads and expected output

In the tech interview:
● You’ll walk us through your HLD and reasoning.
● Show a live demo, and we will also test via ngrok (local services interacting
end-to-end).
● Discuss trade-offs and design decisions.
